# 🧮 Simple Integer Calculator (Python)

This is a basic command-line calculator program written in Python. 
It allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations (**addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**) using **integer values only**.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts two whole numbers (integers) from the user.
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Integer Division (`/`)
- Handles invalid number input (non-integers).
- Checks for division by zero.
- Outputs the result in a readable format like: `10 + 5 = 15`

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the program in your terminal or any Python environment:

```bash
python calculator.py

3. Follow the prompts:

Enter the first number (e.g., 10)

Enter the second number (e.g., 5)

Choose an operation (+, -, *, /)



4. See the result!



Example

Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 2
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): *
8 * 2 = 16

📌 Notes

Only whole numbers (integers) are allowed.

Division uses integer division (i.e., no decimals, only the whole number part of the result).
